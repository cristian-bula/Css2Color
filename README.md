# CSS2Color
 The css2Color is a tool that simplifies the creation of visual effects on HTML elements such as images, text or icons. You only need to specify two colors: one target colo (the color you want to highlight or modify) and one based color (as a reference point). The tool automatically generates the CSS code needed to apply the desired filter, you to easily customize the look of your website.
